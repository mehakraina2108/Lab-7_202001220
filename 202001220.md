# Section : A

- Design the equivalence class test cases

<pre>
Equivalence classes

EC1 - date >=1 and date <= 31
EC2 - date < 1
EC3 - date > 31
EC4 - month >= 1 and month <= 12
EC5 - month < 1
EC6 - month > 12
EC7 - year >= 1900 and year <= 2015
EC8 - year < 1900
EC9 - year > 2015

The dates should not be invalid - 31-02-2020 is an invalid date, since month 2 does not have 31 days.
12 - 13 - 2005 is an example of out of range date.
</pre>

<pre>
Equivalent test cases

EC1 - day - 3, month - 3, year - 2011
output - 2-03-2011

EC2 - day - 0, month - 3, year - 2012
output - Invalid date

EC3 - day - 41, month - 3, year - 2012
output - Invalid date

EC4 - day - 1, month - 1, year - 1980
output - 31/12/1979

EC5 - day - 20, month - -3, year - 2012

# P1

The function linearSearch searches for a value v in an array of integers a. If v appears in the array
a, then the function returns the first index i, such that a[i] == v; otherwise, -1 is returned.

<pre>

public class lab7_1 {
	public static int linearSearch(int v, int[] a) {
	    int i = 0;
	    while (i < a.length) {
	        if (a[i] == v) {
	            return i;
	        }
	        i++;
	    }
	    return -1;
	}
}

# P4

The following problem has been adapted from The Art of Software Testing, by G. Myers (1979). The
function triangle takes three integer parameters that are interpreted as the lengths of the sides of a
triangle. It returns whether the triangle is equilateral (three lengths equal), isosceles (two lengths equal),
scalene (no lengths equal), or invalid (impossible lengths).

<pre>

public class lab7_4 {
	final int EQUILATERAL = 0;
	final int ISOSCELES = 1;
	final int SCALENE = 2;
	final int INVALID = 3;
	public  int triangle(int a, int b, int c)
	{
	if (a >= b+c || b >= a+c || c >= a+b)
		return(INVALID);
	if (a == b && b == c)
		return(EQUILATERAL);
	if (a == b || a == c || b == c)
		return(ISOSCELES);
		return(SCALENE);

	}
}

</pre>

#### Equivalence Partitioning :

| Tester action and input data | Expected Outcome | 
| --- | --- | 
| a+b<=c | INVALID | 
| a=b=c | EQUILATERAL |
| a=b<c | ISOSCELES | 
| a<b<c) | SCALENE | 

#### Boundary Value Analysis :

| Tester action and input data | Expected Outcome | 
| --- | --- | 
| a+b<=c | INVALID | 
| a+c<=b | INVALID |
| b+c<=a | INVALID | 
| a=b=c | EQUILATERAL | 
| a=b<c | ISOSCELES | 
| a=c<b | ISOSCELES | 
| b=c<a | ISOSCELES | 
| a<b<c | SCALENE |

# P5

The function prefix (String s1, String s2) returns whether or not the string s1 is a prefix
of string s2 (you may assume that neither s1 nor s2 is null).

<pre>

public class lab7_5 {
	public static boolean prefix(String s1, String s2)
	{
	if (s1.length() > s2.length())
	{
	return false;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++)
	{
	if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i))
	{
	return false;
	}
	}
	return true;
	}
}

</pre>

#### Equivalence Partitioning :

| Tester action and input data | Expected Outcome | 
| --- | --- | 
| Empty string s1 and s2 | True | 
| Empty string s1 and non-empty s2 | True |
| Non-empty s1 is a prefix of non-empty s2 | True | 
| Non-empty s1 is not a prefix of s2) | False | 
| Non-empty s1 is longer than s2) | False |

#### Boundary Value Analysis :

| Tester action and input data | Expected Outcome | 
| --- | --- | 
| Empty string s1 and s2 | True | 
| Empty string s1 and non-empty s2 | True |
| Non-empty s1 is not a prefix of s2 | False |

# P6

Consider again the triangle classification program (P4) with a slightly different specification: The program
reads floating values from the standard input. The three values A, B, and C are interpreted as
representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program then prints a message to the standard output
that states whether the triangle, if it can be formed, is scalene, isosceles, equilateral, or right angled.
Determine the following for the above program:

a) Identify the equivalence classes for the system

Equivalence Classes will contain:

All sides are positive, real numbers.
One or more sides are negative or zero.
The sum of the lengths of any two sides is less than or equal to the length of the remaining side.
The sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the remaining side.

##### Examples :

<pre>

E1 : a+b<=c (point 3)
E2 : a+c<=b (point 3)
E3 : b+c<=a (point 3)
E4 : a=b, b=c, c=a
E5 : a=b, a!=c 
E6 : a=c, a!=b
E7 : b=c, b!=a 
E8 : a!=b ,b!=c, c!=a
E9 : a^2 + b^2 = c^2 
E10: b^2 + c^2 = a^2
E11: a^2 + c^2 = b^2
E12 : a+b>=c (point 4)
E13 : a+c>=b (point 4)
E14 : b+c>=a (point 4)

</pre>

b) Identify test cases to cover the identified equivalence classes. Also, explicitly mention which test case would cover which equivalence class.

#### Test cases :

1. Right angled triangle (point 1 of (a)) - A = 5, B = 12, C = 13
2. Equilateral triangle (point 1 of (a)) - A = 3, B = 3, C = 3
3. Scalene triangle (point 1 of (a)) - A = 3, B = 4, C = 3
4. Isosceles triangle (point 1 of (a)) - A = 3, B = 2, C =3
5. Invalid Input - A = 1, B = 2, C = 3
6. Invalid Input - A = 0, B = 4, C = -1

c) For the boundary condition A + B > C case (scalene triangle), identify test cases to verify the boundary.

#### Test cases :

1. A = 5, B = 4, C =3
2. A = 5, B = 1, C = 6
3. A = 2, B = 3, C = 6

d) For the boundary condition A = C case (isosceles triangle), identify test cases to verify the boundary.

#### Test cases :
1. A = 4, B = 3, C = 4
2. A = 4, B = 3, C = 3.9
3. A = 4, B = 3, C = 4.1

e) For the boundary condition A = B = C case (equilateral triangle), identify test cases to verify the boundary.

#### Test cases :
1. A = 3, B = 3, C = 3
2. A = 3, B = 2.9, C = 3.1

f) For the boundary condition A2 + B2 = C2 case (right-angle triangle), identify test cases to verify the boundary.

#### Test cases :
1. A = 3, B = 4, C = 5
2. A = 6, B = 8, C = 10

g) For the non-triangle case, identify test cases to explore the boundary.

#### Test cases :
1. A = 2, B = 2, C = 4
2. A = 2, B = 4, C = 2

h) For non-positive input, identify test points.

#### Test cases :
1. A = -3, B = 3, C = 4.5
2. A = 0, B = 4, C = 5

# Section : B

#### 1. Control Flow Graph :

![231516744-1ec1e4b7-e4ed-42f6-8908-33a2906b55a6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124191847/231574511-7ea748b7-036f-48f5-9bf9-2cf6fc00fdd1.png)

#### 2. Construct test sets for your flow graph that are adequate for the following criteria: a. Statement Coverage. b. Branch Coverage. c. Basic Condition Coverage.

a) Statement coverage test sets:

6. p is a vector with three or more different points with different points with different y components and with same x components.
7. p is a vector with three or more points with the same x and y components

</pre>

c) Basic condition coverage test sets:

7. p is a vector with three or more points with the same x and y components
8. p is a vector with some of them having same x component and all of them having same y component

</pre>

#### Test cases examples :

<pre>

1) p=[(x=2,y=3),(x=2,y=2),(x=1,y=5),(x=1,y=4)]
2) p=[(x=5,y=6),(x=3,y=2),(x=3,y=4),(x=1,y=2)]
3) p=[(x=5,y=6),(x=3,y=5),(x=1,y=5),(x=4,y=5),(x=2,y=7)]

</pre>

These 5 test cases covers all - statement coverage, branch coverage and basic condition coverage.
